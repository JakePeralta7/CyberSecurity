# Unusual Parent Process for cmd.exe

The idea is to export a list of parent process of cmd in the last year (not strictly of course), exclude all the usual ones and research the rest.

This principal can be applied to many other processes, it can help us get a better understanding of our network and perhaps lead us to write a detection rule (or actually catch an attacker)
