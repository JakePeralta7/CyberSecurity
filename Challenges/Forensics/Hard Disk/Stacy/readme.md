Thank you for agreeing to help me. We recently had a problem with a former employee and though I cannot prove it, I believe he is the one that erased the files off my thumbdrive. I did some research and I made an image of the drive for you but that is as far as I got. I can replace most of what was lost but there is one file in particular that holds a very important account password. If you could recover that file, I would be extremely grateful.

Also, this is my personal thumbdrive. Keep that in mind please. I'm not sure what you might recover, but I would rather it not get spread around.

Instructions:
>Download the file [stacy.tar.gz](https://github.com/JakePeralta7/CyberSecurity/blob/main/Challenges/Forensics/Hard%20Disk/Stacy/stacy.tar.gz)

>Extract it in a SIFT machine with the command:
tar -xf stacy.tar.gz

>Investigate the output file (called image.dd)
