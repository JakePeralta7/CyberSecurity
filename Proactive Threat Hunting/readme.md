# Proactive Threat Hunting

### In this section I'm going to elaborate on:
- Random ideas about threat hunting that comes to my head
- Research I conducted in threat hunting
- Useful research in threat hunting I've found online

### Some Guidelines:
- I don't want this ideas to become part of the ML movement in threat hunting, because here we start the research with an idea of what we are looking for and what kind of anomalies we want to investigate (in ML the idea is "The model will find something weird for us and we will decide if it's useful")
- We need to forget the detection mindset, if our idea is too specific perhaps it's not the place for it
