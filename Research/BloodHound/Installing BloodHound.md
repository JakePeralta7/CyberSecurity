# Installing BloodHound

## Setting up the Environment
So! We want to install BloodHound and get to work. 

The fastest way for me was installing on linux, [here](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/linux.html#linux) is the official guide.

## Collecting the Data
Now we need to feed BloodHound information about our domain, for that we need a tool that can collect all the data and output it in a way that Bloodhound can understand.

There are three ways to collect the data but the simplest one is using SharpHound, [here](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-collection/sharphound.html#sharphound) is the official guide.
