# What is Active Directory (In Short)

Active Directory (AD) runs on Windows Server and enables administrators to manage permissions and access to network resources.

Active Directory stores data as objects. An object is a single element, such as a user, group, application or device such as a printer. Objects are normally defined as either resources, such as printers or computers, or security principals, such as users or groups.

Active Directory is an important subject that have to be understood in depth in order to succeed in the field of Cyber Security, so I recommend to google and understand what is:
- Forest, Tree, Domain
- Organizational Unit
- Trust Relationships (Two-way / One-way, Transitive / Non-transitive)
- Group Policy Object
- Permission Inheritance
